# querying_csv

**1. Introduction**
This project involves the creation of a Streamlit web application that allows users to upload CSV files, ask questions about the data, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA). The application leverages the LangChain library and the Anthropic API to provide intelligent, context-aware responses to user queries.

**2. Project Overview**
The main goal of this project is to integrate natural language processing capabilities into a user-friendly web interface, enabling users to interact with their data through natural language queries. The project includes three main functionalities:

Question and Answer (QnA) about the data.
Summary Statistics of specified columns.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) plots.
